# Insta-Bot
A personal Insta-Bot that I've created in Python with the Insta-Bot library.

With this bot you can write dm's, follow random peoples or followers of specific pages. You can comment post or video.
Unique thing that you must do is connect with your instagram profile by terminal.
Obviously you can do all by your personal terminal.
