# Insta-Bot
A personal Insta-Bot that I've created in Python with the Insta-Bot library.

With this bot you can write dm's, follow random peoples or followers of specific pages. You can comment post or video.
Unique thing that you must do is connect with your instagram profile by terminal (Email and Password will stay in your personal log file on your pc, so in security).
Obviously you can do all by your personal terminal.

To use the bot select 'instabot.py' and run.
